# SecureChatSystem
This is a fully functional secure chat system that offers a command line interface that allows multiple users to talk to multiple other users simultaneously through a chat server

Full trust is placed in this chat hub as it addresses all network security aspects including : managing conversation sessions, negotiating cipher suites, securely exchanging keys between users using Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) key exchange algorithm, verifying digital signatures and certificates, keeping track of all authenticated users, encrypting / decrypting messages using symmetric cipher algorithm AES with GCM integrity protection mode. It prevents and detects any security attacks throughout the chat session.
